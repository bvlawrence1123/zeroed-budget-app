Zero'd is a minimalist budgeting app I put together to practice coding as well as dip my toes into UX/UI. There is minimal clutter and is for people who enjoy the "budget to zero" way of managing their money. It's very bare-bones basic, but is still in development. I'm trying to keep it neat and tight because most of these apps have way too much going on.
